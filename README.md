# Audio_Visualizers_basic
Project Title: Audio Visualizer - This project is a basic audio visualizer that creates dynamic visual effects in real-time based on the beats and frequencies of an audio file. The visualizer requires an audio file from the user's local system and analyzes its waveform and frequency data to generate responsive visual elements.
